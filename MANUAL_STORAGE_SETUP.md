# Manual Firebase Storage Setup

Since the Firebase CLI is having issues with Storage rules deployment, here's how to set up Storage rules manually in the Firebase Console.

## Step 1: Enable Firebase Storage

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/jema-ai)
2. Click on "Storage" in the left sidebar
3. If Storage is not enabled, click "Get started"
4. Choose "Start in test mode" (we'll update rules manually)
5. Select a location for your storage bucket
6. Click "Done"

## Step 2: Set Storage Rules Manually

1. In the Firebase Console, go to "Storage" â†’ "Rules"
2. Replace the default rules with the following:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';

service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Allow authenticated users to upload and manage their own files
    match /logos/{userId}/{fileName} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    match /banners/{userId}/{fileName} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Allow public read access to banner images
    match /banners/{userId}/{fileName} {
      allow read: if true;
    }
    
    // Allow public read access to logos
    match /logos/{userId}/{fileName} {
      allow read: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

3. Click "Publish"

## Step 3: Test the Setup

1. Restart your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Try to generate a banner - the permission errors should now be resolved

## Alternative: Use Firestore Only

If you continue to have issues with Firebase Storage, you can modify the application to use Firestore for storing image URLs instead of Firebase Storage. This would require updating the `imageService.ts` to store images as base64 data in Firestore documents.

## Troubleshooting

### If Storage Rules Still Don't Work:

1. **Check Storage Bucket**: Make sure the storage bucket is properly configured
2. **Verify Authentication**: Ensure users are properly authenticated before trying to upload
3. **Check Console Logs**: Look for specific error messages in the browser console
4. **Test with Simple Rules**: Try with very permissive rules first:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### If You Want to Skip Storage for Now:

You can temporarily disable Firebase Storage by modifying the `imageService.ts` to use placeholder images or external image hosting services until Storage is properly configured.

## Next Steps

Once Storage is working:
1. Test banner generation and saving
2. Test image downloads
3. Verify that users can only access their own files
4. Test public banner sharing functionality
